dag-failure-agent — DEMO SCENARIO 2: MEDIUM CONFIDENCE

Purpose
-------
This variant is designed to make the agent land in the MEDIUM confidence
tier (0.50-0.74) and open a draft PR with a "[low-confidence]" title
prefix and the confidence score shown in the PR body.

Why this should score medium, signal by signal:
  S_llm        -> The bug is a real but genuinely ambiguous data-quality
                  issue (a malformed upstream record missing a nested
                  field). There isn't one obviously "correct" fix — skip
                  the bad record, default the missing field, or push
                  validation further upstream are all defensible — so
                  Gemini's self-reported confidence should land lower
                  than the single-typo scenario, roughly 0.5-0.7.
  S_retrieval  -> task_id "aggregate_regions" has never been seen before,
                  so the Chroma knowledge base (currently seeded mostly
                  with the test_task fix) should return few or no closely
                  relevant hits.
  S_history    -> No prior merged/rejected record exists yet for
                  (dag1, aggregate_regions), so this falls back to the
                  neutral 0.5 rather than a confirmed 1.0.
  S_logs       -> Same as scenario 1 — a real Composer failure, real logs.
  S_source     -> 1.0, same reasoning as scenario 1.

Note: LLM self-reported confidence isn't perfectly deterministic between
runs. This is designed to land in medium, not guaranteed to. See the
"If it doesn't land where expected" section of TESTING-GUIDE.md.

DEPLOYMENT NOTE (see TESTING-GUIDE.md):
  This file's *contents* get copied into tests/dag1.py before the demo run
  (both committed to GitHub and uploaded to the Composer DAGs bucket).
  Do not deploy this file under its own name — dag_id must be "dag1" to
  pass the receiver's ALLOWED_DAG_IDS filter. task_id is different from
  scenario 1 on purpose (see S_history/S_retrieval notes above).
